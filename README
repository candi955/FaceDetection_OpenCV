This is a student project I did for the University of Advancing Technology Advanced Programming Concepts course. Feel
free to use or modify it as you wish.  However, please make sure you include this readMe page and the code with
all references.  Pictures that aren't my own personal pictures were pulled off of the openSource Yale haar datasets,
or Creative Commons.  I will include those references below. All code references are written with hashes in the
actual code.

The mainPage is a main menu that offers to take the user to the FaceDetection.py page to detect faces from images.
Otherwise, choices can lead the user to the EmotionAndAge page to detect emotion and age from images.  I mostly used
OpenCV and Algorithmia to do these tasks.
